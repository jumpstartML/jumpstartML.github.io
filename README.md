## Jumpstart Machine Learning




Data and AI are shaping up to be the tools of the future. We at Jumpstart ML believe that an early exposure to these tools and their applications would be invaluable to students. With these tools, students would be capable of working on high-level research projects even in high school.

At Jumpstart ML, we have a team of PhD-level instructors who have years of experience in programming, scientific computing, machine learning, data analytics, statistics and data visualization.
